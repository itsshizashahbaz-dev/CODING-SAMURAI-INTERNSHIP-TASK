# Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Minimax with Alpha–Beta Pruning)

 🧠 Project Overview
This Python program lets you play Tic-Tac-Toe against an unbeatable AI. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha–Beta pruning** to evaluate all possible moves and play optimally.



## ⚙️ How It Works
- **Board Representation:** The grid is a 1D list of 9 cells (0–8).
- **Minimax Algorithm:** Simulates all possible future moves.
  - +1 → AI wins
  - -1 → Human wins
  - 0 → Draw
- **Alpha–Beta Pruning:** Optimizes Minimax by skipping branches that cannot influence the result, making the AI faster.
