Rule-Based Chatbot (Coding Samurai Internship Task 1)

üìò Introduction
This project was completed as part of the Coding Samurai AI Internship (Task 1). The goal was to develop a Rule-Based Chatbot using Python that can simulate simple customer support interactions. The chatbot identifies user queries using predefined rules and responds appropriately based on detected keywords.
üß© Project Overview
The chatbot is designed to handle various types of queries such as:
‚Ä¢ Greetings (e.g., Hello, Hi)
‚Ä¢ Product-related questions
‚Ä¢ Store hours and location information
‚Ä¢ Price inquiries
‚Ä¢ Return policy and refund information
‚Ä¢ Technical support issues
‚Ä¢ Exit commands (e.g., bye, quit, exit)

The program uses Python's `random` module to generate varied responses and the `re` module (Regular Expressions) for keyword matching and input analysis.
üíª Technologies Used
‚Ä¢ Python 3.x
‚Ä¢ random ‚Äì for randomized response selection
‚Ä¢ re ‚Äì for regular expression-based text pattern matching
‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. The chatbot greets the user and asks for their name.
2. It then processes the user's input and searches for keywords that match predefined intents.
3. Based on the intent, it returns an appropriate response.
4. If the user enters any exit command (like 'bye' or 'exit'), the chatbot ends the conversation.
5. Random responses are used to make the conversation more natural and engaging.
üß† Key Learnings
‚Ä¢ Understanding of Rule-Based AI systems
‚Ä¢ Implementation of chatbot logic using Python conditionals and loops
‚Ä¢ Usage of regular expressions for smarter input matching
‚Ä¢ Improved coding structure and modular programming practices
‚Ä¢ Enhanced skills in text processing and string manipulation
üöÄ How to Run
1. Install Python 3.x on your system.
2. Save the chatbot Python file as `chatbot.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the same directory.
4. Run the chatbot using the command:

   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```
